Dailymart (Licensed under CC) is a fully functioning Social Networking site built on top of Laravel and Vue.js frameworks. It is a marketplace brought in the form of a social network. It is not the only one of its kind, because this type of service can be also offered on Instagram Shop or Facebook Store, but the key of Dailymart is that it comes with a new flexible design and can be very scalable in the future when it comes to adding new features to help businesses expand larger digitally.

This is only a preview of Dailymart, because I want to keep it private for confidentiality reasons. This is the largest one and it shows my expertise in Laravel and web development in general.
